# A Nikke Tracker
Track your Nikke collection and easily share your box to others. No longer do you have to flip between multiple screenshots to find out what other people have or don't have.
## Marking Collected Nikkes
Simply click each Nikke in the tracker to mark as collected or not. Nikkes are sorted by the default ordering of the Nikkepedia since the default ordering of the box is different for everyone.
## Saving
Collection is saved in to your browser everytime the `Save` button is clicked in the upper right corner. Old saves will still be valid when a new Nikke is released.
## Sharing
Clicking the `Generate Share URL` creates a link to the currently marked collection and copies it to your clipboard. This does NOT save the current collection to your browser and CAN be different from what is currently saved in your browser. Similar to saving, old share links will still work when new Nikkes are released.
